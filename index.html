        <h1 style="text-align:center;">A little strange
            <br>information?</h1>
        <p class="ya-ystala">I'm 23 years old, and I'm trying to write codes for the first time, without having any experience behind my back. I went to the RSS courses to get basic experience in programming. I don't have English skills, I haven't studied languages. I learned
            from my friend that there are courses for people like me. It became very interesting to me, it gives me new plot twists in my life.</p>
        <p class="ya-ystala">This site is my first work with code. Having only theoretical knowledge, it was incredibly difficult for me to bring to life what was in my head. I was very afraid to use flex elements because I don't understand them well. I tried to make a basement
            and a head through other teams, but something always happened wrong for me. So I turned to flex elements, reread the article again and I did it! I was happy that I didn't have extra padding, and my basement didn't hang in the middle of the
            text! </p>
